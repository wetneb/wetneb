## ✨ Migrate to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) with me! ✨

My open source work primarily happens [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/wetneb).
I encourage you to migrate your projects there. It's a wonderful platform that you can also tweak yourself by making contributions to [Forgejo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo), the open source forge software that it runs. You can take back control of a tool you use everyday!

It has many advantages:
* it lets you enforce that all members of an organization are visible from the outside, offering welcome transparency on the composition of teams.
* it lets you disable PRs on repositories, something that GitHub doesn't let you do. Useful when a repository isn't meant to integrate external contributions for some reason.
* it doesn't try to sell you hallucinations-as-a-service all the time.
* it's run by a nonprofit using minimal resources.
* it has a pretty low uptime, meaning that you are regularly encouraged to take breaks. How refreshing!
